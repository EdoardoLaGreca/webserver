Hi.
First of all, thanks for downloading my webserver!
I guess you may want to run it so here's what you need to do: run the executable.
Yes it's that easy and now that you know, enjoy.

If you're stuck, typing
	webserver -h
may help you.
Don't forget that if you're on Windows, you need to add ".exe" at the end of the executable name.
